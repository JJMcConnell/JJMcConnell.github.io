  					<p> Hi, I'm Joseph Jerald McConnell IV, my father is Joseph Jerald McConnell III, my grandfather is Joseph Jerald McConnell II, and my great grandfather is dead. I was born in Guam and lived in Illinois, Florida, Louisiana, and California before deciding to settle down back in Florida at the ripe age of 8. I'm currently a Computer Science major in my last semester at the University of Florida. I like websites, I like design, and I don't think I like writing bios. </p>
